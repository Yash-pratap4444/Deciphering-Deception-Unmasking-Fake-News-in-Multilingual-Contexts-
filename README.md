# Deciphering-Deception-Unmasking-Fake-News-in-Multilingual-Contexts-
"Deciphering Deception: Unmasking Fake News in Multilingual Contexts" suggests a focus on understanding and exposing false information in a diverse linguistic environment. The term "fake news" typically refers to misinformation or disinformation intentionally spread to deceive the public.
Fake news has developed as a global problem in the quickly changing landscape of digital communication. While tremendous progress has been made in creating tools to detect false news in English, there remains a notable gap in non-English languages. This research dives into the specific problems and possibilities that these languages bring, providing a thorough evaluation and comparative analysis of existing methodologies. The findings highlight the need of linguistically varied and inclusive methods to combatting fake news. The paper finishes with a discussion of potential future research directions, emphasising advanced language adaptation techniques and a comprehensive knowledge of the socio-cultural factors driving the propagation of false news across diverse linguistic communities.
